Front-End: React-Native, Redux, Google Maps API;

workflow for a user:
workflow for a host:
Wireframes look like:
Whole layout: 
User view when they login:
Database schema:

Proof of Concept: 1 user (host) should be able to see another user's (guest's) location on a map & it should change as the user is moving. 
                  (sockets + maps must work together)
